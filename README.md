# PHP Blast 

## What Is This?

I just learned what PHP was yesterday, and naturally, my first thought was: "What if I made Block Blast entirely in PHP?"

This was a terrible idea. I did it anyway.

## The Horror

This is Block Blast written in **pure PHP** with minimal JavaScript. Everything runs server-side. Sessions store the game state. Every click reloads the page. 

## Why?

Why not?

## What I Learned

- PHP is actually pretty cool for server-side stuff
- You can make games in PHP (but maybe shouldn't)
- Sessions are neat
- Mixing PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file is chaotic
- I now understand why modern frameworks exist

## How to Run This 

```bash
./start.sh
```

Or:

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:5000
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` 

## Features

- ✅ 10x10 grid
- ✅ Hover preview
- ✅ Score tracking
- ✅ Game over detection
- ✅ All in one 700+ line PHP file
- ✅ Questionable life choices

## Tech Stack

- PHP (because I just learned it)
- Vanilla JavaScript (like 50 lines)
- CSS (gradient backgrounds = professional)
- Poor decision making

## What I'd Do Differently

Probably use literally any other approach. But hey, it works!

## License

Do whatever you want with this. If you use it, I'm both honored and concerned.

## Acknowledgments

- PHP, for being surprisingly capable
- My brain, for suggesting this in the first place
